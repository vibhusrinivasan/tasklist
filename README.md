This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started
This is an example to use the Agentic capablities as of Oct 2025, in CoPilot. Used Claude Sonnett 3.5 to create a simple task list application. This application does not use a MCP. It used a simples postgres table and uses prisma which is a ORM tool for Postgres. This is just for learning purposes and has no other intent. ![A descriptive diagram](https://github.com/vibhusrinivasan/tasklist/blob/main/public/TasklistDemo.png "Example Tasklist view")
First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
